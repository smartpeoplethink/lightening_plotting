This a research profect between Samuel Halperin (aka smartpeoplethink), Alexander Huber, and Naomi Watanabe.
The files are meant for the information to be supplied by a txt file named "info.txt". 
They should be in a format that a new piece of information is given at a line on a multiple of four.
The information should also be in the same order described by the reference txt.
For confidatiality purposes it was not included here.
If you have any questions please reach out to me. 

Thank you, Sam
